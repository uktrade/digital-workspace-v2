# Feature permissions

This document outlines some areas of the site that we are looking at to improve the permissions and behaviours.

## Edit Team information

At the moment, only people with the `peoplefinder.change_team` permission can edit the Team's information.

### Proposed changes

Update the permissions so that either people with the `peoplefinder.change_team` permission, OR the Team leads.

> Note: up for discussion

## Edit Person profile

At the moment, anyone can edit anyone else's profile.

### Proposed changes

Update the permissions so that you can edit your own and your line reports' profiles. Also we should check the `peoplefinder.change_person` permission so that people with this permission can edit other people's profile.
