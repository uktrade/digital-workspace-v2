# Editing pages

## Page functionality

### Author

The author is the person that we display to readers of a page at the top with the following look:

![Page author](../assets/features/page-author.png){ loading=lazy }

#### How to set/change the author?

The page author looks in the following locations:

* In the edit form for the page, in the "Publishing" tab, the "Page author" field
    * This will let you search and select a person that has a profile on the intranet
* In the edit form for the page, in the "Settings" tab, there is an old field "Perm sec as author" if this is set to True, the value will be the current Perm Sec's name
    * This is an old field, and the new way to set the Perm Sec as the author is to use the "Page author" field in the "Publishing" tab
* The person that first published the page
* The person that first created the page

Based on the above logic, the best way to manage the page author is the "Page author" field in the "Publishing" tab on the edit page.
