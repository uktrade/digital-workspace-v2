# Content owner

Some pages have a the "content owner" and "content owner email" fields.
These fields are used to mark who "owns" the content of the page. This is different from the person that edited the page.

Content owners are used on the following page types:

- Network
- Policy
- Guidance
- How Do I
- Topic

The content owner is presented to readers of the page instead of the person selected in the [page author](./author.md) field.

## How to set/change the content owner?

When editing a page that has a Content Owner, there should be a tab at the top called "Content owner". In this tab you will find the fields to do with content ownership.
