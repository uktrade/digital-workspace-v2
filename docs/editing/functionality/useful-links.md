# Sidebar - Useful Links


The useful links feature allows you to add a list of links to show in the sidebar of the current page. It can be used to help find other pages that might be of relevance to them.

## What pages have useful links?

Currently, the useful links feature is only available on Network pages.

## Where do I add a useful link for a page?

To add a useful link, simply go to the page's edit form, click the "Promote" tab, add links to the "Useful links" field.

## There are extra links showing on my page! Where are they coming from?

The useful links component will show links that have been added in the page edit form, alongside links to any child pages of the current page (excluding child network pages).
This means if you are looking at "Page 1" in the following hierarchy:

- Page 1
    - Page 2
    - Page 3
    - Page 4 (is a network page)
    - Page 5

You will see the links for pages 2, 3 and 5 in the useful links sidebar area. You will NOT see children of child pages (only one level deep).
