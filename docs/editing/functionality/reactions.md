# Reactions

Currently, reactions can only be added to News pages and anyone can react to a page with reactions enabled. If a page also has comments enabled, people can react to those comments too!

## How do I disable reactions for a page?

Reactions can be disabled on a page by navigating to the edit form for the page, clicking on the "Settings" tab, and un-checking the "Allow reactions" checkbox.
