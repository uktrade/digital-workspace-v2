# Comments

Currently, comments can only be added to News pages and anyone can comment on a page that has comments enabled. By default, a new page will have comments enabled.

## How do I disable comments for a page?

Comments can be disabled on a page by navigating to the edit form for the page, clicking on the "Settings" tab, and un-checking the "Allow comments" checkbox.

## Who can delete comments?

The only person that can delete a comment is the person that created it (or a developer with production access).
