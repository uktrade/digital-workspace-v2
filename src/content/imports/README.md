# Testing the importer

The importer is built to work on documents built using the DBT styling within the DBT systems.
Ideally we'd have example documents uploaded to this codebase and write tests against them to make sure that the output of the importer works as expected. However, we have chosen to not upload any example documents for the time being as they could contain data that we do not want to be public.

## How to test the importer?

I have created a test document and uploaded it to the Employee Experience sharepoint at: **Documents / Intranet / Policy import test documents**.

Download a document found in that folder and use the import tool when creating a policy page and upload the test document.
