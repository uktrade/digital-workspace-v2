Therefore, we decided it was best to keep the implementation of the app simple and write our own audit log system.</p> <p>The audit log system we have written does not make use of django signals. This is because that approach has difficulties handling many-to-many fields. Instead, we have a simple and explicit approach where you must call the audit log service after you have made changes for them to be tracked.</p> <p>For this approach to work you will need to provide a flat, serialized and denormalized \"view\" of the model you wish to be tracked. This allows us to avoid the complexity of tracking many-to-many fields by denormalizing them. This is often achieved using <code>ArrayAgg</code> which provides an array representation of the many-to-many relationship. For an example of this in action, please take a look at the <code>PersonAuditLogSerializer</code> class in <code>peoplefinder/services/person.py</code>.</p> <p>One downside to this approach is that if you do not call the audit log service after making a change, for example modifying a model instance in a shell, then the changes will not be tracked.</p> <p>For more information, please read through the docstrings and code in <code>peoplefinder/services/audit_log.py</code> and check out an example of how to use the service from a view in the <code>ProfileEditView</code> class in <code>peoplefinder/views/profile.py</code>.</p>"},{"location":"features/search/","title":"Search","text":""},{"location":"features/search/#how-search-works","title":"How search works","text":"<p>Search is handled by OpenSearch, an ElasticSearch clone that runs as a service on AWS.

At the same time matches anywhere within the content should be equally ranked, and (for simplicity) we treat matches in any heading as equally valid.</p> <p>As an example, a page containing headings \"How to sign up\" and \"Quick start\" would be indexed as a document with the <code>headings</code> field contents being \"How to sign up Quick start\".</p> <p>Note that fields containing metadata for filtering etc will also be present on the search documents.</p>"},{"location":"features/search/#explicit-fields","title":"Explicit fields","text":"<p>Each text field on each of the models above will be indexed twice; first as a raw, unprocessed field with an <code>_explicit</code> suffix, and also as a stemmed and procesed field using the standard field name (this \"tokenized\" approach is the Wagtail default).
